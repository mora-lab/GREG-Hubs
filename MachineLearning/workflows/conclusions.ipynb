It was found that a 70:30 partition worked best for building and testing the model, respectively. Additionally, the SMOTE transformation of the 70% train data was sourced to build the model. This brought about parity into the model, vis-Ã -vis the distribution of classes. In all cell-types, the purported \"Non-Hubs\" were far larger in number than \"Hubs\" (upto a 1000 fold). This had to be taken into account, particularly while training the model. </p>\n",
